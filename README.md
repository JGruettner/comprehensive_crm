# comprehensive_crm
The goal ist to develop a comprehensive crm toolset, which focuses on revenue

###### Mission Statement
Every data scientist dreams to predict future events - me too. But the world of time series forecast is much darker and bitter than expectet.
Therefore this project will predict various values for a basic company. And, as the world is rarely 1-dimensional, the focus will be on predicting multiple attributes.


###### Codes
1. Univariate time series forecasting
2. Multivariate time series forecasting
3. Adding More Attributes and Keras LSTM 

**1. Univariate time series forecasting**
Forecasting revenue for the next four periods and make the prediction availble via Rest API

**2. Multivariate time series forecasting**
Base the revenue prediction on multiple attributes and detect correlations, for example the importance of growth markets

**3. Adding More Attributes and Keras LSTM**
Calculate customer KPIs, like RFM and CLV, and use a neuronal network to make revenue predictions
